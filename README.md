# VuforiaModelExploder
Repo for an AR model exploder.

Currently the start and end transform locations are defined at design time, but ideally would be placed at run time by the end user.

The parts within the "start" area and collected and moved over to the "end" location (hold "A" key).

The parts can be returned to the start location by holding the "S" key.

Currently the parts are placed randomly in a spherical area around the "end" location, this is merely to simulate user input, eventually the precise locations would be defined automatically by using a smart algorithm or manually by the user.
